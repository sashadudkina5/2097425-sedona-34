# Sedona

Sedona is my first-ever study project, a static website showcasing the town of Sedona as a tourist spot. The project is based on the repository [https://github.com/htmlacademy-htmlcss/2097425-sedona-34](https://github.com/htmlacademy-htmlcss/2097425-sedona-34), which provided the project structure and Figma design. The website consists of 2 static pages and is designed primarily for desktop dimensions.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes HTML and CSS. Key areas of focus during the study process included flex and grid CSS layouts, relative and absolute positioning and accessibility principles.
